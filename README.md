# 60 Benchmark Suite (Java Implementation)
This repository contains 60 benchmark functions comprising various separable, non-separable, uni-modal, multi-modal, noisy, shifted, rotated, and composite minimization problems. Compositions and transformations on 37 base functions become 60 unique optimization problems.

These benchmark functions have been used in the literature to study the particle swarm optimization algorithm, as the various problems capture many different landscape features.

This suite has been used in the following works:
